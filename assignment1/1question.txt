Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.
Soln:-
Python's popularity can be attributed to several key features that make it an attractive choice for programming.
Some of the most significant advantages are as follows

Easy to Learn: Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to learn, making it a great language for beginners.

High-Level Language: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their program without worrying about memory management and other details.

Object-Oriented: Python is an object-oriented language that supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easy to write reusable and modular code.

Large Standard Library: Python has a vast and comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data structures.

Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using it. This makes it easier to write code and allows for more flexibility.

Cross-Platform: Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Extensive Community: Python has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.

Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a wide range of libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for various applications, such as web development (Django, Flask), data science (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), and machine learning (TensorFlow, Keras).
