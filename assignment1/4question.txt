Python has various operators that can be used to perform different operations. These operators can be categorized into several types:
soln)
***Arithmetic Operators***
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.

--> + (Addition): Adds two numbers.
-->  - (Subtraction): Subtracts one number from another.
-->  * (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
-->  / (Division): Divides one number by another.
-->  // (Floor Division): Divides one number by another and returns the largest whole number.
-->  % (Modulus): Returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.
-->  ** (Exponentiation): Raises one number to the power of another.


# Addition
print(5 + 3)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
print(5 - 3)  # Output: 2

# Multiplication
print(5 * 3)  # Output: 15

# Division
print(6 / 3)  # Output: 2.0

# Floor Division
print(7 // 3)  # Output: 2

# Modulus
print(7 % 3)  # Output: 1

# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)  # Output: 8

***Comparison Operators***
Comparison operators are used to compare values.

--> == (Equal): Checks if two values are equal.
--> != (Not Equal): Checks if two values are not equal.
--> > (Greater Than): Checks if one value is greater than another.
--> < (Less Than): Checks if one value is less than another.
--> >= (Greater Than or Equal): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
--> <= (Less Than or Equal): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

Examples:-

# Equal
print(5 == 5)  # Output: True

# Not Equal
print(5 != 3)  # Output: True

# Greater Than
print(5 > 3)  # Output: True

# Less Than
print(3 < 5)  # Output: True

# Greater Than or Equal
print(5 >= 5)  # Output: True

# Less Than or Equal
print(3 <= 5)  # Output: True

***Logical Operators***
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations.

- and (Logical And): Returns True if both conditions are true.
- or (Logical Or): Returns True if at least one condition is true.
- not (Logical Not): Returns the opposite of the condition.

Examples:


# Logical And
print(5 > 3 and 5 < 7)  # Output: True

# Logical Or
print(5 > 3 or 5 < 3)  # Output: True

# Logical Not
print(not 5 > 3)  # Output: False

***Assignment Operators****
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- = (Assignment): Assigns a value to a variable.
- += (Addition Assignment): Adds a value to a variable.
- -= (Subtraction Assignment): Subtracts a value from a variable.
- *= (Multiplication Assignment): Multiplies a variable by a value.
- /= (Division Assignment): Divides a variable by a value.
- //= (Floor Division Assignment): Divides a variable by a value and assigns the largest whole number.
- %= (Modulus Assignment): Assigns the remainder of the division of a variable by a value.
- **= (Exponentiation Assignment): Raises a variable to the power of value.

Examples:

# Assignment
x = 5
print(x)  # Output: 5

# Addition Assignment
x += 3
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction Assignment
x -= 2
print(x)  # Output: 6

# Multiplication Assignment
x *= 2
print(x)  # Output: 12

# Division Assignment
x /= 2
print(x)  # Output: 6.0

***Bitwise Operators***
Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers.

- & (Bitwise And): Performs a bitwise AND operation.
- | (Bitwise Or): Performs a bitwise OR operation.
- ^ (Bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
- ~ (Bitwise NOT): Performs a bitwise NOT operation.
- << (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of a number to the left.
- >> (Right Shift)
