6). How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples0
Conditional statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. Python provides several types of conditional statements:

If Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.

Example:


# If statement
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")


In this example, the if statement checks if x is greater than 10. If the condition is true, it prints "x is greater than 10". Otherwise, it prints "x is less than or equal to 10".

If-Else Statement
The if-else statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
Example:


# If-else statement
age = 25
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")


In this example, the if-else statement checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, it prints "You are an adult". Otherwise, it prints "You are a minor".

If-Elif-Else Statement
The if-elif-else statement is used to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on those conditions.

Example:

# If-elif-else statement
grade = 85
if grade >= 90:
    print("A grade")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B grade")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("C grade")
else:
    print("F grade")

In this example, the if-elif-else statement checks the grade and prints the corresponding grade letter.

Nested If Statements
Nested if statements are used to check multiple conditions within each other.

Example:


# Nested if statements
x = 5
y = 10
if x > 0:
    if y > 5:
        print("Both x and y are positive and y is greater than 5")
    else:
	print("x is positive but y is not greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
